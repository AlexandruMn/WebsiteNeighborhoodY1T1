                In the middle of the Grote Market, stands tall the Saint Bavo Church. This cathedral is a very old and beautiful building that has been around for a long time. It has a tall, pointed tower and a gorgeous facade, testifying to the skill of the people who built it long ago. Whenever you walk through Bakenes, you'll always see the cathedral. It's a big part of the neighborhood's history and importance.
